# Multi-omics analysis of KIRC
Title: Integrative analysis of single-cell and bulk multi-omics data to reveal subtype-specific characteristics and therapeutic strategies in clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients

Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) is the most prevalent subtype of malignant renal cell carcinoma and is well known as a common genitourinary cancer. Stratifying tumors based on heterogeneity is essential for better treatment options. In this study, consensus clusters were constructed based on gene expression, DNA methylation, and gene mutation data, which were combined with multiple clustering algorithms. After identifying two heterogeneous subtypes, we analyzed the molecular characteristics, immunotherapy response, and drug sensitivity differences of each subtype. And we further integrated bulk data and scRNA-Seq data to infer the immune cell composition and malignant tumor cell proportion of subtype-related cell subpopulations.
