# Multi-omics analysis of KIRC
Title: Multi-omics comprehensive analysis of renal clear cell carcinoma to distinguish subtypes with different molecular characterizations and therapeutic strategies

We conducted a comprehensive analysis of multi-omics data with 10 clustering algorithms to reveal the molecular characteristics of KIRC patients and validated the relevant conclusions by single-cell analysis and external data. Our findings discovered new KIRC subtypes and may further guide personalized and precision treatments.
